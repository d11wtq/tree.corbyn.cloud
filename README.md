# Corbyn Family Tree

This is a purely personal project that traces my ancestry, currently into the
19th century, though this may evolve over time.

The project is a Github Pages website, currently just a single page. It
displays the family tree with a couple of variations following different
branches.

The content is generated as static HTML from a simple React app. It's all very
minimal.

To generate a new static site, run:

```
yarn webpack
```

Then commit and push the updated `index.html` and `dist/` files.
